## Summary

We can see that 38.7% of Non-Vine Reviews were 5-Star ratings, however 51% of the Vine Reviews were 5-Star ratings. From our results we can conclude that there may be a bias among reviews in the Vine Program. An additional analysis we could perform could include some additional statustics including mean, median, and mode for these reviews.
